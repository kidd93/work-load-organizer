# Purpose
This is a work day scheduler to aid in completing daily and time tasks.

# Made with
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

# Additions to Starter Code
* Added a current day date to the header of the index.html page.
* Inserted divs for each time block.
* Referenced the style.css sheet to figure out which classes and id's for each time blocks to use. 
* Attempted many tries to save to the local storage but didn't have any luck. I will have to continue researching different approaches that help me understand it better.
